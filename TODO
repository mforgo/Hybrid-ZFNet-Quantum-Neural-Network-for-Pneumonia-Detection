# Week 1: Quick Wins
- Increase layers to 3-4 (should boost accuracy by 3-5%)
- Try mutual information feature selection instead of PCA
- Add L2 regularization (reduces overfitting)

# Week 2: Architecture
- Implement data re-uploading (biggest potential gain: +5-10%)
- Try different entanglement patterns (all-to-all, ring, etc.)

# Week 3: Advanced
- Ensemble of 3-5 models (+2-4% accuracy)
- Hyperparameter sweep (learning rate, regularization)
