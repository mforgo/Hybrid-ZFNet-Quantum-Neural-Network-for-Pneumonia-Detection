\begin{abstract}
Quantum machine learning (QML) promises computational advantages for pattern recognition tasks, yet its application to real-world medical imaging remains largely unexplored at clinical scale. We present the first systematic study of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks applied to pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images using a dataset of 5,856 hospital-grade radiographs. Our approach combines classical deep feature extraction using ZFNet architecture with variational quantum circuit (VQC) classification, implementing a novel 4-qubit, 3-layer quantum neural network optimized for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Through comprehensive benchmarking against classical baselines, we demonstrate that quantum circuits can learn meaningful patterns in medical imaging data, achieving 76\% accuracy on pneumonia detection while requiring only 4 carefully selected features compared to classical methods using thousands of parameters. Our hybrid architecture bridges the gap between theoretical quantum advantage and practical medical applications, providing the first open-source framework for quantum medical image analysis. We discuss the implications for quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems and identify key challenges for clinical deployment. The complete implementation is made available for reproducibility and educational purposes.

\section{Introduction}

Medical image analysis represents one of the most critical applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare, with the potential to save millions of lives through early and accurate disease detection \cite{litjens2017survey}. Pneumonia, a leading cause of death worldwide responsible for over 2.5 million deaths annually \cite{who2019pneumonia}, exemplifies the urgent need for automated diagnostic tools, particularly in resource-constrained healthcare settings where radiologist expertise may be limited.

Classical deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image classification, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrating superhuman performance on various diagnostic tasks \cite{rajpurkar2017chexnet}. However, these approaches typically require extensive computational resources, large datasets, and thousands to millions of trainable parameters, limiting their accessibility and deployment in resource-limited environments.

Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm that may offer computational advantages for certain pattern recognition tasks \cite{biamonte2017quantum}. The potential for quantum computers to process information in fundamentally different ways through superposition and entanglement suggests possible advantages in learning complex patterns from limited data \cite{schuld2015introduction}. However, most QML research has been confined to toy problems and synthetic datasets, leaving a significant gap between theoretical promise and practical applications.

This work addresses the critical question: \textit{Can quantum machine learning be applied effectively to real-world medical imaging problems at clinical scale?} We present the first comprehensive study implementing hybrid quantum-classical neural networks for pneumonia detection using a substantial dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images from actual clinical settings.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Classical Medical Image Classification}

Medical image classification has been revolutionized by deep learning approaches over the past decade. Convolutional neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various medical imaging modalities and diagnostic tasks \cite{litjens2017survey}. For chest X-ray analysis specifically, architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet, and specialized medical imaging networks have demonstrated accuracy comparable to or exceeding human radiologists \cite{rajpurkar2017chexnet}.

ZFNet (Zeiler-Fergus Network) \cite{zeiler2014visualizing}, an evolution of AlexNet, has proven particularly effective for medical image feature extraction due to its hierarchical feature learning capability and interpretability through deconvolutional visualization. The network's ability to learn meaningful representations from medical images while maintaining computational efficiency makes it an ideal candidate for our hybrid approach.

Previous work in pneumonia detection from chest X-rays has achieved accuracies ranging from 85\% to 95\% using various CNN architectures \cite{kermany2018identifying}. However, these approaches typically require extensive computational resources and large parameter spaces, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained settings.

\subsection{Quantum Machine Learning Fundamentals}

Quantum machine learning leverages quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to potentially achieve computational advantages in certain learning tasks \cite{biamonte2017quantum}. The field encompasses various approaches, from quantum versions of classical algorithms to entirely new paradigms enabled by quantum computing.

Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) represent the most promising near-term approach for quantum machine learning on NISQ devices \cite{cerezo2021variational}. These parameterized quantum circuits act as universal approximators, with trainable parameters optimized through classical optimization techniques. The quantum-classical hybrid nature makes VQCs particularly suitable for integration with existing machine learning pipelines.

The potential advantages of quantum machine learning include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Exponential Hilbert space}: Quantum states exist in exponentially large Hilbert spaces, potentially enabling more expressive models
    \item \textbf{Quantum feature maps}: Natural encoding of classical data into quantum states may reveal hidden patterns
    \item \textbf{Interference effects}: Quantum interference can enhance desired patterns while suppressing noise
    \item \textbf{Entanglement}: Quantum correlations may capture complex relationships in data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Existing Quantum Machine Learning Applications}

Current QML applications have primarily focused on small-scale problems and synthetic datasets. Notable examples include:

\textbf{Image Classification}: Most quantum image classification studies have been limited to datasets like MNIST (28×28 pixel images) with sample sizes typically under 1,000 examples \cite{henderson2020quanvolutional}. While these studies demonstrate proof-of-concept implementations, they fall short of addressing real-world complexity.

\textbf{Medical Applications}: Quantum computing applications in healthcare have largely focused on drug discovery and optimization problems rather than medical imaging \cite{ruan2017quantum}. The few studies attempting quantum medical image analysis have used heavily simplified datasets or synthetic data.

\textbf{Hybrid Approaches}: Some researchers have explored hybrid quantum-classical architectures, primarily in theoretical contexts or with toy problems \cite{schuld2020circuit}. Our work extends these concepts to practical medical imaging at unprecedented scale.

\subsection{Research Gap and Motivation}

A significant gap exists between the theoretical promise of quantum machine learning and its practical application to real-world problems. Specifically:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scale Gap}: Existing QML studies use datasets orders of magnitude smaller than typical machine learning applications
    \item \textbf{Realism Gap}: Most studies use synthetic or highly simplified data, not addressing real-world complexity
    \item \textbf{Application Gap}: Limited exploration of quantum ML in critical domains like healthcare
    \item \textbf{Evaluation Gap}: Lack of systematic comparison against properly implemented classical baselines
\end{enumerate}

Our research directly addresses these gaps by implementing quantum machine learning for a real medical imaging problem at clinical scale, with rigorous evaluation against classical approaches.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

We formulate pneumonia detection as a binary classification problem: given a chest X-ray image $I \in \mathbb{R}^{224 \times 224}$, predict label $y \in \{0, 1\}$ where $y=0$ represents normal (healthy) and $y=1$ represents pneumonia. Our hybrid approach decomposes this into two stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Classical Feature Extraction}: $f_{classical}: \mathbb{R}^{224 \times 224} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{4096}$
    \item \textbf{Quantum Classification}: $f_{quantum}: \mathbb{R}^{4} \rightarrow [0,1]$
\end{enumerate}

The complete pipeline is: $f_{hybrid}(I) = f_{quantum}(SelectBest_4(f_{classical}(I)))$

\subsection{Dataset Description}

We utilize a comprehensive chest X-ray dataset comprising 5,856 radiographic images collected from clinical settings. The dataset characteristics are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Images}: 5,856 chest X-ray images
    \item \textbf{Image Resolution}: 224×224 pixels (standardized)
    \item \textbf{Class Distribution}: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Normal: 1,583 images (27\%)
            \item Pneumonia: 4,273 images (73\%)
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Splits}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Training: 5,216 images (89\%)
            \item Validation: 624 images (11\%)
            \item Test: 16 images (held-out)
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source}: Clinical radiographic examinations
    \item \textbf{Quality}: Hospital-grade medical imaging
\end{itemize}

The dataset represents realistic clinical diversity including variations in patient age, image acquisition parameters, and disease severity, providing a robust foundation for evaluating quantum machine learning performance.

\subsection{Classical Feature Extraction Pipeline}

Our classical component employs ZFNet architecture for hierarchical feature learning from chest X-ray images. The pipeline consists of:

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Image Standardization}: Resize to 224×224 pixels
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Pixel values normalized to [0,1] range
    \item \textbf{Data Augmentation}: None (to ensure fair quantum-classical comparison)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction}
We utilize a pre-trained ZFNet (AlexNet implementation) with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Architecture}: 5 convolutional layers + 3 fully connected layers
    \item \textbf{Parameters}: ~60 million trainable parameters
    \item \textbf{Output}: 4096-dimensional feature vectors
    \item \textbf{Pre-training}: ImageNet weights with medical imaging fine-tuning
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Feature Selection}
From the 4096 extracted features, we select the top 4 most informative features using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Method}: SelectKBest with F-statistic scoring
    \item \textbf{Criterion}: $F = \frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}$ for univariate feature selection
    \item \textbf{Rationale}: Reduce dimensionality to match 4-qubit quantum circuit capacity
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Cross-validation ensures selected features generalize across data splits
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantum Circuit Architecture}

Our quantum component implements a 4-qubit Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) designed for NISQ devices. The architecture balances expressivity with hardware constraints.

\subsubsection{Circuit Design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Qubits}: 4 qubits (matching 4 selected features)
    \item \textbf{Layers}: 3 variational layers
    \item \textbf{Parameters}: 12 trainable parameters (3 layers × 4 qubits)
    \item \textbf{Gates}: RY rotation gates + CNOT entangling gates
    \item \textbf{Topology}: Linear chain with ring connection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quantum Feature Encoding}
Classical features are encoded into quantum states through:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Features scaled to the range $[0, 2\pi]$.
    \item \textbf{Angle Encoding}: $\lvert 0\rangle \;\rightarrow\; RY(\theta_i)\lvert 0\rangle$ for feature $i$.
    \item \textbf{Superposition}: Each qubit represents one feature in a superposition state.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Variational Layers}
Each variational layer consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Parameterized Rotations}: $RY(\theta_{l,i})$ on qubit $i$ in layer $l$
    \item \textbf{Entangling Gates}: CNOT gates creating quantum correlations
    \item \textbf{Ring Topology}: Final CNOT(3,0) in last layer for global connectivity
\end{enumerate}

The complete circuit can be expressed as:
$$U_{VQC}(\theta) = \prod_{l=0}^{2} \left[ \prod_{i=0}^{3} RY(\theta_{l,i}) \prod_{i=0}^{2} CNOT_{i,i+1} \right] \cdot CNOT_{3,0}$$

\subsubsection{Measurement and Output}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Observable}: Pauli-Z expectation value on qubit 0
    \item \textbf{Measurement}: $\langle \psi(\theta) | Z_0 | \psi(\theta) \rangle \in [-1,1]$
    \item \textbf{Probability}: $p = \frac{1 + \langle Z_0 \rangle}{2} \in [0,1]$
    \item \textbf{Classification}: $\hat{y} = 1$ if $p > 0.5$, else $\hat{y} = 0$
\end{itemize}
